# GLaDOS
GLaDOS implemented with the intelligence of openAI and the voice of uberduck.ai
####Developed for Windows, propably needs tweaks for Linux.

The script listens to your primary microphone to perform speech to text conversion, the text will then be send to OpenAI where GPT will react to it in the style of GLaDOS.
The response will be forwarded to uberduck.ai where the glados voice model will generate the voice. Finally the voice will be played to renspond to your initial text.
